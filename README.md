### Colour Scheme
To come up with a colour combination, I searched for what is the best colour to match the name of my website. The colour deep purple comes up as the top search and to enhance the dark colour I added a touch of gold. When I searched for a palette, [Scheme Color](www.schemecolor.com) has the combination I was looking for.

I also checked the colour combination contrast on 
[Eightshapes Grid Contrast](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/)

### Fonts
I wanted a plain Serif text that is easy to read. PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design. Fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

### Imagery Used
Some of the images I used were downloaded from the web (list of websites below) and some are my own original photos. They were resized in [www.tinypng.com](www.tinypng.com) for easy loading of the website. I created the logo to match the color scheme I chose for my website.
