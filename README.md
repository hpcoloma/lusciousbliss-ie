### Colour Scheme
To come up with a colour combination, I searched for what is the best colour to match the name of my website. The colour deep purple comes up as the top search and to enhance the dark colour I added a touch of gold. When I searched for a palette, [www.schemecolor.com](www.schemecolor.com) has the combination I was looking for.
