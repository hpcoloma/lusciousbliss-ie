### Colour Scheme
To come up with a colour combination, I searched for what is the best colour to match the name of my website. The colour deep purple comes up as the top search and to enhance the dark colour I added a touch of gold. When I searched for a palette, [Scheme Color](www.schemecolor.com) has the combination I was looking for.

I also checked the colour combination contrast on 
[Eightshapes Grid Contrast](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/)

### Fonts
I wanted a plain Serif text that is easy to read. PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design. Fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

### Imagery Used
Some of the images I used were downloaded from the web (list of websites below) and some are my own original photos. They were resized in [www.tinypng.com](www.tinypng.com) for easy loading of the website. I created the logo to match the color scheme I chose for my website.

- The aim is to makew the website responsive to mobile devices first and the style for all other devices will be added to make it responsive to all devices.
- Photos will be reduced in size but not in quality for faster loading.
- All sections are responsive to different device size.

## **Technology Used**
- **Language**
    - HTML
    - CSS3
- **Frameworks, Libararies & Programs**
    - Photoshop was used to create the logo and wireframes.
    - [Google Fonts](www.googlefonts.com) to import PT Serif to the stylesheet.
    - [Font Awesome](www.fontawesome) for footer and contact information icons.
    - [GitHub](www.github) for hosting project codes, maintaining repository.
    - [Codeanywhere](www.codeanywhere.com) I initially used this to build my project but find it very slow a lot of times, it takes time for the updates to take effect and longer time to load my workspace.
    - [Gitpod](www.gitpod) I switch to Gitpod and find it easier to use and faster.
    - [Favicon](www.favicon.io) to create favicon for my title.
    - [Am I Responsive](https://amiresponsive.co.uk/) to show the image of the website on different device size.
